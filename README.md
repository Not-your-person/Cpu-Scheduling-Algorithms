# 🧠 CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulation

A simple and educational simulation of **CPU Scheduling Algorithms** written in **C**.  
This project helps visualize how different scheduling strategies work in operating systems.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Implements four major CPU scheduling algorithms:
  1. **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**
  2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
  3. **Priority Scheduling**(lower the number higher the priority)
  4. **Round Robin**
- Calculates:
  - **Average Waiting Time**
  - **Average Turnaround Time**
- Displays a **Gantt Chart** showing process execution order.
- Helps compare performance and fairness of different scheduling techniques.

## ⚙️ Compilation and Execution

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Not-your-person/Cpu-Scheduling-Algorithms.git
cd Cpu-Scheduling-Algorithms
```
### Step 2: Compile the Program

Use GCC (or any C compiler):
```
gcc main.c scheduling.c round_robin.c -o cpu
```
### Step 3: Run the Program
```
./cpu
```
## 🧾 Input Format

When you run the program, it will ask for process details.
You need to provide:

Number of processes (n)

Arrival time of each process

Burst time (CPU time required)

Priority (for priority scheduling only)

Time Quantum (for Round Robin scheduling)

## Example Input
<pre> Enter the number of processes: 4 Enter details for each process: 
  Process 1 → Arrival Time: 0 Burst Time: 5 Priority: 2 
  Process 2 → Arrival Time: 1 Burst Time: 3 Priority: 1 
  Process 3 → Arrival Time: 2 Burst Time: 8 Priority: 4 
  Process 4 → Arrival Time: 3 Burst Time: 6 Priority: 3
  Enter time quantum (for Round Robin): 2 </pre>
## 🧮 Expected Output

The program will display:

Gantt Chart showing the order of process execution

Average Waiting Time

Average Turnaround Time

Example Output (Round Robin)
<pre> Gantt Chart: P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P1 | P3 | P4 | P3 (in bar graph) Average Waiting Time = 4.25 Average Turnaround Time = 8.00 </pre>
Example Output (SJF)
<pre> Gantt Chart: P2 | P1 | P4 | P3 (in bar graph) Average Waiting Time = 3.50 Average Turnaround Time = 7.25 </pre>
# 📊 Comparison Summary
| Algorithm       | Type             | Strengths                | Weaknesses              |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **FCFS**        | Non-preemptive   | Simple to implement      | Convoy effect (slow)    |
| **SJF**         | Non-preemptive   | Low average waiting time | Can cause starvation    |
| **Priority**    | Pre/Non-preempt. | Flexible, priority-based | Low priority starvation |
| **Round Robin** | Preemptive       | Fair, responsive         | Context switch overhead |
